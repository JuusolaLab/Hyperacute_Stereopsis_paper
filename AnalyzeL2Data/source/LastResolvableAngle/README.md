# Dynamic grating analysis
## This python code enables you to
- detect the ROIs of a TIF/AVI video
- detect the peaks of a response to this kind of stimulus. 
- compute a resolvability for each pair of peaks
- output an html file summing up the analyis
- store the last resolvable angles for each ROI

## How to use
- Make sure the right paths are written at the #PATH section of the common.py file
- Download the Stimuli.7z file and extract on the relevant path (that you chose in the common.py file)
- Run dyna_grating.py (Play with the #CONSTANT section parameters to adjust the model)
